 <p style="font-size: 19px ;color: aliceblue; background-color: rgb(4, 12, 82);"><em><strong>A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulae, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element. In chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of presenting information about the chemical proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, using chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (âˆ’) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A chemical formula is not a chemical name since it does not contain any words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula. Chemical formulae can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of molecules and chemical substances, and are generally more limited in power than chemical names and structural formulae.</strong></em></p><p style="font-size: 20px; background-color: rgb(194, 192, 189); color:rgb(17, 26, 103);">

 <p style="font-size: 19px ; background-color:  rgb(151, 9, 148); color: white;"><em><strong>The formula is a fact or a rule written with mathematical symbols. It usually connects two or more quantities with an equal sign. When you know the value of one quantity, you can find the value of the other using the formula. It helps to solve the questions quickly. In algebra, geometry and other topics, formulas are used to simplify the process of reaching the answer and saving time. Mathematics is divided into various branches as per the way of calculation involved and the topics covered by them all the branches have various formulas that are used for solving various mathematics problems. The branches include geometry, algebra, arithmetic, percentage, exponential, etc. <br>A formula is a mathematical expression or definite rule that is derived from the relation between two or more quantities and the derived final product is expressed in symbols. The formulas in math include numbers known as constants, letters that represent unknown values and are known as variables, mathematical symbols known as signs, and exponential powers in some cases.</strong> </em></p>
